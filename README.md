# Projet_Python_Mongo

Hello ! Welcome to my data project based on a library system, using MongoDB and Python.

This library system includes : 
- Searching : you can do search filtering ( title, year, authors... ), or just a classic search !
- Adding : you can add documents by inserting the informations required.
-  Deleting : you can delete documents by a filtering system for precise demands, or not.
