# Projet_Python_Mongo

Hello ! Welcome to my data project based on a library system, using MongoDB and Python.

This library system includes : 
- Searching : you can do search filtering ( title, year, authors... ), or just a classic search !
- Add : you can add files by inserting the informations required.
- Deletion : you can delete files by a filtering system for precise demands, or not.
- Statistics


Before starting, some tips :
- All instructions are in FRENCH ! An english version will come later.
- Pymongo required
- Use collection "books" ( JSON ), to insert in your database MongdoDB.
- Change the name of your database in config.py
- Tests on main_project.py
- Some instructions at the end may lead you back at the beginning, this means the file(s) doesn't exist. 

  Enjoy !
